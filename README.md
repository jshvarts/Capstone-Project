# Capstone-Project

This is a digital version of the Flat Stanley tradition.

The app allows the user to take a picture, add an image of the Flat Stanley and add a caption and share it via a variety of apps. 
In addition, the user is able to share his/her creation with other users of the app via Firebase.

Users can browse and share existing Flat Stanley creations and filter them by their own creations and ones created by others. In addition, users
are able to search Flat Stanleys via keyword search.
